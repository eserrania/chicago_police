## The Role of Networks in “Bad Actor” Identification: Informing Investigative Journalism
### CAPP 30254 Machine Learning for Public Policy
### Final Project

This project contains the implementation of a Machine Learning pipeline to identify bad actors among Chicago Police Department officers.

Aequitas.ipynb: run aequitas module to test for fairness and bias of the models

crime_portal.py: adds features generated from the Chicago Open Data Portal

data: folder containing data from the Invisible Institue Citizens Police Data Project that was used used for this project 

descriptive_stats.ipynb: some descriptive statistics of the data

feature_generation.py: contains the code that generates the model's features

feature_list.xlsx: description of all the features

full_pipeline.py: defines the TrainTest and RawDfs classes

ml_loop.py: code used to run the models with different parameters and evaluation metrics

read_data.py: code to read the datasets used in the project

README.md: this file

report.pdf: report containing the description, implementation and findings of the analysis

requirements.txt: libraries and versions required for running the code

run_pipeline.ipynb: runs the machine learning models (takes about five hours to run)

train_test.py: code that performs the temporal splits on the datasets
